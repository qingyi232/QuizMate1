"In structural engineering, what is the primary purpose of reinforcement in reinforced concrete?
A) To increase compressive strength
B) To provide tensile strength
C) To reduce weight
D) To improve thermal properties","Civil Engineering","Engineering School","en","B) To provide tensile strength","Concrete is strong in compression but weak in tension. Steel reinforcement is added to provide tensile strength, creating a composite material that can resist both compressive and tensile forces.","civil-engineering,structural,concrete,materials"
"电力系统中，三相对称负载星形连接时，线电压与相电压的关系是：
A) 线电压 = 相电压
B) 线电压 = √2 × 相电压
C) 线电压 = √3 × 相电压
D) 线电压 = 2 × 相电压","电气工程","工程学院","zh-CN","C) 线电压 = √3 × 相电压","在三相对称系统的星形连接中，线电压是两相电压的矢量差，其大小等于相电压乘以√3，相位超前相电压30°。","电气工程,三相电路,电压关系,电力系统"
