"In quantum mechanics, what does Heisenberg's uncertainty principle state?
A) Energy cannot be created or destroyed
B) The position and momentum of a particle cannot both be precisely determined
C) Light behaves as both wave and particle
D) Matter and energy are interchangeable","Physics - Quantum Mechanics","University","en","B) The position and momentum of a particle cannot both be precisely determined","Heisenberg's uncertainty principle states that there is a fundamental limit to how precisely we can simultaneously know both the position and momentum of a particle. The more precisely one is determined, the less precisely the other can be known.","physics,quantum-mechanics,uncertainty-principle,heisenberg"
"热力学第二定律可以表述为：
A) 能量守恒
B) 熵增原理
C) 牛顿第二定律
D) 质量守恒","热力学","大学","zh-CN","B) 熵增原理","热力学第二定律的一种表述是熵增原理：在孤立系统中，总熵永远不会减少。这说明了自然过程的不可逆性和能量品质的退化。","热力学,熵,物理定律,不可逆过程"

A) Mitochondria
B) Ribosomes
C) Golgi apparatus
D) Endoplasmic reticulum","Biology - Cell Biology","High School","en","B) Ribosomes","Ribosomes are the cellular organelles responsible for protein synthesis. They translate mRNA into proteins by linking amino acids together in the sequence specified by the genetic code.","biology,cell-biology,protein-synthesis,ribosomes"
